# stocksocial
Mitchell and Christian app for Modern Web Dev

## Setup
### Local Setup
1) Ensure a version of node is installed
2) git clone this repo
3) go to react-app folder
4) install all packages/dependencies using npm install
5) To get real time stock data, change the flag in APIContext to true. To preserve api requests, we use mock data when flag is set to false.

## Running the App
To run the app, simply follow the create-react-app instructions which can be found [here](https://github.com/cmille47/stocksocial/blob/main/react-app/README.md)
This will create a localhost enviornment where you can interact with the app.
